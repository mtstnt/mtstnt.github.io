Flower is a drag-and-drop flowchart editor and runner, fully built on the client-side. As for now, it is a work in progress.

Currently, it is available on this [Github repository](https://github.com/mtstnt/flower).

In this project, I used ReactJS with Reactflow for the flowchart editor. All the expressions tokenization, parsing, and interpreting the nodes are written from scratch.

Pictures coming soon :)
